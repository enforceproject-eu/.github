# Welcome to Enforce Project

We aim to promote sustainable practices and ensure environmental regulatory compliance within and between organisations.
The project will use living lab and citizen science methodologies to develop innovative tools for environmental compliance.
This involves bridging the gap between data reporting, monitoring and policy enforcement needs, incorporating innovative data collection, analysis and stakeholder engagement.
The project will establish a pan-European collaboration hub introducing the concept of data readiness level (DRL) to assess data for legal purposes.
Moreover, it will leverage geospatial intelligence and AI to advance environmental governance practices in line with the Green Deal Data Space initiative.
Enforce will test and evaluate these tools at 8 pilot sites across 7 countries while also promoting a capacity-building programme and policy recommendation activities.
